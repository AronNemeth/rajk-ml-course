# DBSCAN

## Checkout clustering possibilities

Checkout sklearn algorithms:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html
Whats good in using sklearn models in whatever you can?

## Explain the DBSCAN algorithm

eps, min_samples and metric
core, border points and outliers

# UMAP and T-SNE

## UMAP explained visually

# Feature engineering

Bias-variance tradeoff --> model complexity is bounded --> engineer information to be picked up easily.
Model complexity is the cost of incorporating information, which can be lowered using feature engineering.

# Decision tree
